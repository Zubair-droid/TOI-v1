      <h3>WHAT IS THE ‘THINK OF IT’ – YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM?</h3>

      <p>YLP exists for the youth to act in unison with an aim to create an impact by addressing social, political, and environmental issues. It makes them; the youth realize the significance of a youth-led nation.

        They need to lead life by their inherent nature; not by the conventional means, which this program supports and remains at disposal for. It’s rather easy to rely upon secondary sources such as newspapers and news channels to keep a tab on everything 
        happening around the globe however gone are the days when these sources were devoid of bias and prejudice. It’s time for the youth to organize themselves amidst this cut-throat quest for truth which is never easy to discover let alone expressed in coherent terms. The program blends learning with leadership and fun, aiming at the wholesome development of the most important and energetic cluster of our society – the youth!
        
        To answer the ‘What’ behind this program’s existence would be to usher the youth to, in very straightforward terms, ‘Think of It’ i.e. the ongoing issues pertaining to multifarious spheres, morality, ideals, the sense of justice that prevails and to conjecture upon ideas that should be prevailing instead. Youth and leadership share an intrinsic yet undervalued relationship, we are here to bridge the gap between 
        the two and provide a platform to equip the leaders of tomorrow.</p>

        We encourage youth to be a part of the summits representing them like The Youth Parliament and The State Conferences hosted bi-annually to bring the leader within them in front of eminent persona’s whose experiences offer a lot to learn about politics, governance and the world.

The promotions and other managerial positions will be filled on the merit of performance. Hence, your efforts will never be in vain.

    </div>


</div>

 <p> Poverty, hunger, education problems, unemployment, environmental degradation, ill-treatment of animals and wildlife species, and a long list of ignored critical problems require immediate attention. It’s an irony to call ourselves a democracy when people are slowly forgetting its true meaning. It’s preferable to succumb to divisive politics rather than paying heed to issues that make life difficult for the poor and destitute.

  The Environmental, political, social, and economic crisis is leading us to doomsday. We have still not elevated to the stage of assessing these problems; on how adverse their effects can be. We chose our goals of establishing differences rather than taking the first step and being a helping hand to those around us. Empathy is a long lost value that the youth must work together to re-incorporate into the society.</p>
  
  <p>TOI-YLP attempts to mirror every aspect to you: directing and leading you to the root, motivating you to work upon a quick response to urgent problems. Sometimes, it’s impossible to decipher the regulations and bills however as a team, you are capable of unimaginable change.</p>
  <p> All the issues in our society need ‘Empowered Energetic Enthusiasts’ and the youth can think as well as suggest without preconceived notions. The youth has many opportunities in the world to explore, to drive their life in all modes they wish to, with all terrains of emotions to unearth.
  
  Our sole remains to see a nation led by the youth. There is a need to incorporate unique mindsets in all spheres. It’s imperative to have a straightforward group of leaders laying down the terra firma to sustain the future. We hope to invigorate determination in able individuals and provide them with a clear path and vision through our various programs.</p>

<p class="takeaway-text">Modern methodologies could be more effectively used to overpower current problems; issues considered insignificant could be unraveled. Interaction will take place and maximum indulgence can be taken care of by the youth. The vibe of each city and the whole nation could change with cultural activities, sports, events, and other active and hyper-active initiatives.

  The pre-requisite to leadership is the ability to empathy and understanding. Even though our main emphasis is on the prior skill, we pay equal importance to the latter values without which even top most leaders would fail. Leadership doesn’t merely come from authority. The benefits for you are numerous if you possess a flair for indignant hard work because no change is achieved overnight. You will learn both soft and practical skills that are required to be heard and get your opinions through.
  
  Our vision of society is an amalgam of ideas and change. If we can think of it, so can you! We believe that there is a hidden potential inside each of us, especially the youth and we invite you to explore it with us.</p>
